You wake up, dazed, in what appears to be a shady forest. A thick blanket of fog slowly rolls in from all directions, restricting your vision for more than around twenty feet in any direction. You struggle to recall how you ended up in this forest, but all you can remember is stepping into a curious circle of mushrooms in your backyard before waking up here. Maybe you should look around for that mushroom ring...

You gather your courage and slowly stand up.

Fairy Ring
An Interactive Fiction by Austin Gill
Release 1 / Serial number 110921 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Foggy Clearing
This is the shady clearing you first woke up in. The white fog still appears to be rolling in steadily. There is a towering tree in the middle of the clearing. It looks like there are some firm branches you could use to climb it. The forest appears to continue both to the east and to the west.

Below the towering tree lies a simple pile of leaves. There is also a strange ring of mushrooms growing in the grass.

Top of Towering Tree
You teeter precariously on a thin branch at the top of the towering tree. Despite how high you are, you can&apos;t see much else besides other tree tops through the thick fog. To the left of you is a crooked branch just barely within arm&apos;s reach.

Foggy Clearing
This is the shady clearing you first woke up in. The white fog still appears to be rolling in steadily. The forest appears to continue both east and west. There is a towering tree in the middle of the clearing. It seems almost mystical by nature.

Below it lies a simple pile of leaves. There is also a strange ring of mushrooms growing in the grass.

Foggy Clearing
This is the shady clearing you first woke up in. The white fog still appears to be rolling in steadily. The forest appears to continue both east and west. There is a towering tree in the middle of the clearing. It seems almost mystical by nature.

Below it lies a simple pile of leaves. There is also a strange ring of mushrooms growing in the grass.

The blue mushroom reminds you of the mushroom ring you saw in your backyard before ending up in this forest. Perhaps there&apos;s a connection?

Quiet Thicket
A tranquil river flows slowly from a dark cave to the north toward a distant waterfall to the south. Several willow trees crowd the thicket, drooping toward the damp grass sadly. A hollow fallen oak tree also lays broken against the edge of the river.

Beneath The Rainbow
You walk along the river to be met with a glorious rainbow at the edge of the waterfall. It shimmers with cool mist from the crashing waterfall. Majestic eagles can be seen flying nearby.
